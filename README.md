## Installation ##

### Requirements ###

* Working Nionswift install

### Commands to install ###
```
pip install --user nionswift-elabftw-plugin
```

## Setup ##
When you first run the plugin, it will ask you for the address and port for the ElabFTW server. That can be copied from your browser and pasted into the plugin.

The usernames and passwords you generate are local and independent of ElabFTW itself. You just need to get the API key to connect to the server.

You need to generate an API key from ElabFTW:
